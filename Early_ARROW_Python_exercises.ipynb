    "\n",
    "As you read through the notebook and try running the code cells, it is important to remember these are minimal solutions which make no attempt to check input data for errors. For example, what happens if you input `twenty one` instead of `21` when prompted for a floating point number? You might enjoy trying to modify these examples to make them more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to scientific programming there will often be more than one way to compute the same result or make the same plot. So, for many examples there is no unique \"right\" answer. If your solution gives the correct result that's right enough! \n"
